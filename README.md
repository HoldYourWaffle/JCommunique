# JCommunique

JCommunique is a free, open-source library written in pure Java. It uses Swing to show pop up notifications on the desktop and offers a range of features with a simple to use API. Refer to the demo package for examples.

### Instructions for use / contribution:
JCommunique is set up as an Eclipse project. To contribute or compile a jar from source, just import the project into Eclipse via these instructions: http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/. If you have any questions about contributing, please feel free to contact me at sam (dot) pfrommer (at) gmail.com.

Stable JCommunique releases as jars are available here: https://github.com/spfrommer/JCommunique/releases
You can add these to your project's build path just as you would include any normal jar. This process can vary across IDEs, but Eclipse instructions are available here: http://www.wikihow.com/Add-JARs-to-Project-Build-Paths-in-Eclipse-%28Java%29
